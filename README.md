# My Todo List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### components

`Add.jsx`
This provides a list view of the values entered by the user when the 'Add' button is pressed.

`Done.jsx`
This renders the todo done or removed based on the state of 'isDone'.

`Remove.jsx`
This will render the 'remove' of the Todo.

`Todo.jsx`
This is just a file that components the 'title' and 'content' of the Todo.
